# URGENT: Fix Render Port Binding Error

## Problem
Your deployment is failing because of a PORT environment variable mismatch:

```
‚úÖ Gunicorn listening on port 10000 (correct - Render's automatic assignment)
‚ùå Render scanning for port 5000 (wrong - from manual PORT variable in dashboard)
```

## Root Cause
You have manually set `PORT=5000` as an environment variable in your Render dashboard. This conflicts with Render's automatic PORT assignment (10000).

## SOLUTION: Delete the PORT Variable from Render Dashboard

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Select your service: `company-policy-rag`

2. **Delete the PORT Environment Variable**
   - Click **"Environment"** in the left sidebar
   - Look for an environment variable named **PORT** with value **5000**
   - Click the **trash/delete icon** (üóëÔ∏è) next to it
   - Click **"Save Changes"**

3. **Redeploy**
   - The deployment will automatically trigger
   - OR manually trigger: Go to "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

## Why This Happens

Render web services automatically set the `PORT` environment variable to **10000**. When you manually override it to **5000**:
- Your `startCommand` uses `$PORT` ‚Üí Render sets this to 10000 internally
- Gunicorn binds to **10000** (using Render's automatic PORT)
- But Render's health check looks for **5000** (your manual override)
- Result: Port mismatch ‚Üí deployment timeout

## Expected Result After Fix

Once you delete the PORT variable, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
‚úÖ Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
‚úÖ Scanning for open port 10000
‚úÖ Port 10000 is open
‚úÖ Your service is live
```

## Configuration Files (Already Correct)

- ‚úÖ `render.yaml` - Uses `$PORT` correctly
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Uses `$PORT` correctly  
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Falls back to 10000 for local development
- ‚úÖ `runtime.txt` - Python 3.11.9
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - All compatible packages

## DO NOT

‚ùå Do NOT manually set a PORT environment variable in Render
‚ùå Do NOT hardcode port numbers in your start command
‚ùå Let Render manage the PORT automatically

## Alternative (If Required to Use Specific Port)

If your organization REQUIRES port 5000, update `render.yaml`:

```yaml
startCommand: gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app --timeout 120
```

And keep PORT=5000 in environment variables. But this is NOT recommended.
